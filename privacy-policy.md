This Privacy Policy explains how **Taboo Game** (“the App”) handles information when you use it.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A) Information you provide
The App does **not** require you to create an account.  
If you contact us (e.g., by email), we may receive the information you include in your message (such as your email address and the content of your request).

### B) Automatically collected information
The App (and/or third-party services) may collect limited technical information to operate properly and improve performance, such as:
- device type and model
- operating system version
- language and region
- app version
- approximate diagnostics (crash logs, performance data)

> We do **not** collect your name, phone number, precise location, or contacts unless you explicitly provide them (e.g., by emailing us).

## 2. How We Use Information
We use information only to:
- keep the App working reliably
- fix bugs and improve performance
- respond to support requests
- understand usage trends in an aggregated way (if analytics is enabled)

---

## 3. Ads & Analytics (Third-Party Services)
Taboo Game may use third-party services (for example, ad networks or analytics providers). These services may collect information as described in their own policies.

Common examples:
- **Google AdMob** (ads)
- **Google Analytics for Firebase / Firebase Crashlytics** (analytics & crash reporting)

If you use these services, you should link to their privacy pages in your store listing or in-app.

## 4. Data Sharing
We do **not** sell your personal information.

We may share limited data only in these cases:
- with service providers (e.g., crash reporting, analytics, ads) strictly to provide their services
- if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security

---

## 5. Data Retention
- Support emails: kept only as long as needed to resolve your request.
- Diagnostics/analytics (if enabled): retained according to the third-party provider’s retention settings.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
Taboo Game is **not intended for children under 13** (or the minimum age required in your country).  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will delete it.

---

## 7. Your Choices
Depending on your device and region, you may be able to:
- reset your advertising ID
- limit ad personalization
- disable analytics sharing (if the App offers a setting)

You can also contact us to request deletion of any data you directly provided (e.g., support emails).
